# ⚡️ An Efficient Metaheuristic Algorithm for Optimal Capacitor Allocation in Electric Distribution Networks ⚡️

This repository has the implementation of a metaheuristic for capacitor allocation in radial distribution networks. A load flow for a radial power distribution system based on the backward/forward sweep method is used.
